Description: A classification (decision) tree is constructed from survival data with high-dimensional covariates.
 The method is a robust version of the logrank tree, where the variance is stabilized.
 The main function "uni.tree" returns a classification tree for a given survival dataset.
 The inner nodes (splitting criterion) are selected by minimizing the P-value of the two-sample the score tests.
 The decision of declaring terminal nodes (stopping criterion) is the P-value threshold given by an argument (specified by user).
 This tree construction algorithm is proposed by Emura et al. (2021, in review).
