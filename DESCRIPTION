Title: A Survival Tree Based on Stabilized Score Tests
Version: 1.3

Description: A classification (decision) tree is constructed from survival data.
 The method is a robust version of the logrank tree, where the variance is stabilized.
 This function returns a classification tree for a given survival dataset. The decision of making inner nodes (splitting criterion) is
 based on the univariate score tests.
 The decision of declaring terminal nodes (stopping criterion) is the P-value threshold given by an argument.
 This tree construction algorithm is proposed by Emura et al. (2021, in review).
